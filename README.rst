This project (**version 0.1.0a3**) is a Python port of `ebook-tools`_ which is
written in Shell by `na--`_. The Python script `ebooktools.py`_ is a collection
of tools for automated and semi-automated organization and management of large
ebook collections.

`:warning:`

  * For the moment, the ``ebooktools.py`` script is only tested on **macOS**.
    Eventually, it will be tested on linux.
  * **More to come!** Check the `Roadmap <#roadmap>`_ to know what is coming
    soon.

About
=====
The `ebooktools.py`_ script is a Python port of the `shell scripts`_ from
`ebook-tools`_ and makes use of the following modules:

- ``edit_config.py`` edits a configuration file which can either be the main
  config file that contains all the options defined
  `below <#usage-options-and-configuration>`__ or the logging config file whose
  default values is defined in `default_logging.py`_. The `edit`_ subcommand
  from the ``ebooktools.py`` script uses this module.
- ``convert_to_txt.py`` converts the supplied file to a text file. It can
  optionally also use *OCR* for ``.pdf``, ``.djvu`` and image files. The
  `convert`_ subcommand from the ``ebooktools.py`` script uses this module.
- ``find_isbns.py`` tries to find `valid ISBNs`_ inside a file or in a
  ``string`` if no file was specified. Searching for ISBNs in files uses
  progressively more resource-intensive methods until some ISBNs are found, for
  more details see
  
  - the `documentation for ebook-tools`_ (shell scripts) or
  - `search_file_for_isbns()`_ from ``lib.py`` (Python function where ISBNs
    search in files is implemented).
  
  The `find`_ subcommand from the ``ebooktools.py`` script uses this module.
- ``organize_ebooks.py`` is used to automatically organize folders with
  potentially huge amounts of unorganized ebooks. This is done by renaming
  the files with proper names and moving them to other folders:
  
    * By default it `searches`_ the supplied ebook files for `ISBNs`_,
      downloads the book metadata (author, title, series, publication date,
      etc.) from online sources like Goodreads, Amazon and Google Books and
      renames the files according to a specified template.
    * If no ISBN is found, the script can optionally search for the ebooks
      online by their title and author, which are extracted from the filename
      or file metadata.
    * Optionally an additional file that contains all the gathered ebook
      metadata can be saved together with the renamed book so it can later
      be used for additional verification, indexing or processing.
    * Most ebook types are supported: ``.epub``, ``.mobi``, ``.azw``,
      ``.pdf``, ``.djvu``, ``.chm``, ``.cbr``, ``.cbz``, ``.txt``, ``.lit``,
      ``.rtf``, ``.doc``, ``.docx``, ``.pdb``, ``.html``, ``.fb2``, ``.lrf``, 
      ``.odt``, ``.prc`` and potentially others. Even compressed ebooks in 
      arbitrary archive files are supported. For example a ``.zip``, ``.rar`` 
      or other archive file that contains the ``.pdf`` or ``.html`` chapters 
      of an ebook can be organized without a problem.
    * Optical character recognition (`OCR [Wikipedia]
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition>`_) can be
      automatically used for ``.pdf``, ``.djvu`` and image files when no ISBNs 
      were found in them by the fast and straightforward conversion to 
      ``.txt``. This is very useful for scanned ebooks that only contain
      images or were badly OCR-ed in the first place.
    * Files are checked for corruption (zero-filled files, broken pdfs,
      corrupt archive, etc.) and corrupt files can optionally be moved to
      another folder.
    * Non-ebook documents, pamphlets and pamphlet-like documents like saved
      webpages, short pdfs, etc. can also be detected and optionally moved to
      another folder.
      
    **Ref.:** [ORG]_
      
  The `organize`_ subcommand from the ``ebooktools.py`` script uses this
  module.
  
- ``rename_calibre_library.py`` traverses a calibre library folder, renames
  all the book files in it by reading their metadata from calibre's
  ``metadata.opf`` files. Then the book files are either moved or symlinked
  to an output folder along with their corresponding metadata files.
  The `rename`_ subcommand from the ``ebooktools.py`` script uses this module.
- ``split_into_folders.py`` splits the supplied ebook files (and the
  accompanying metadata files if present) into folders with consecutive names
  that each contain the specified number of files. The `split`_ subcommand
  from the ``ebooktools.py`` script uses this module.

Thus, you have access to various `subcommands`_ from within the
``ebooktools.py`` script.

`:star:`

  * `ebook-tools`_ is the **original** Shell project I ported to Python. I 
    used the same names for the script options (short and longer versions) so
    that if you used the shell scripts, you will easily know how to run the
    corresponding `subcommand`_ with the given options.
  * `ebooktools.py`_ is the name of the Python script which will always be
    referred that way in this document (i.e. no hyphen and ending with ``.py``)
    to distinguish from the original Shell project ``ebook-tools``.
  * ``pyeboooktools`` is the name of the Python package that you need to
    `install <#install-pyebooktools>`__ to have access to the ``ebooktools.py`` 
    script.

Installation and dependencies
=============================
To install the script ``ebooktools.py``, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies `below <#other-dependencies>`__. 
2. Install the ``pyebooktools`` package `below <#install-pyebooktools>`__.

Python dependencies
-------------------
* **Platforms:** macOS [soon linux]
* **Python**: >= 3.6
* ``lxml`` >= 4.4 for parsing Calibre's ``metadata.opf`` files.

`:information_source:`

  When `installing <#install-pyebooktools>`_ the ``pyebooktools``
  package, the ``lxml`` library is automatically installed if it
  is not found or upgraded to the correct supported version.

Other dependencies
--------------------
As explained in the documentation for `ebook-tools 
<https://github.com/na--/ebook-tools#shell-scripts>`__, you need recent
versions of:

  * `calibre`_ for fetching metadata from online sources, conversion to txt
    (for ISBN searching) and ebook metadata extraction. Versions **2.84** and
    above are preferred because of their ability to manually specify from which
    specific online source we want to fetch metadata. For earlier versions you
    have to set ``isbn_metadata_fetch_order`` and
    ``organize_without_isbn_sources`` to empty strings.
  * `p7zip`_ for ISBN searching in ebooks that are in archives.
  * `Tesseract`_ for running OCR on books - version 4 gives better results even
    though it's still in alpha. OCR is disabled by default and another engine
    can be configured if preferred.
  * **Optionally** `poppler`_, `catdoc`_ and `DjVuLibre`_ can be installed for
    faster than calibre's conversion of ``.pdf``, ``.doc`` and ``.djvu`` files
    respectively to ``.txt``.
  * **Optionally** the `Goodreads`_ and `WorldCat xISBN`_ calibre plugins can
    be installed for better metadata fetching.

|

`:star:`

  If you only install **calibre** among these dependencies, you can still have
  a functioning program that will organize and manage your ebook
  collections: 
  
  * fetching metadata from online sources will work: by `default 
    <https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/fetch-ebook-metadata.html#
    cmdoption-fetch-ebook-metadata-allowed-plugin>`__
    **calibre** comes with Amazon and Google sources among others
  * conversion to txt will work: `calibre`'s own `ebook-convert`_ tool
    will be used
    
  All `subcommands`_ should work but accuracy and performance will be
  affected as explained in the list of dependencies above.

Install ``pyebooktools``
-------------------------
To install the ``pyebooktools`` package:

1. It is highly recommended to install the ``pyebooktools`` package in a
   virtual environment using for example `venv`_ or `conda`_.

2. Make sure to update *pip*::

   $ pip install --upgrade pip

3. Install the ``pyebooktools`` package (**bleeding-edge version**) with
   *pip*::

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/raul23/pyebooktools#egg=pyebooktools

`:warning:`

   Make sure that *pip* is working with the correct Python version. It might be
   the case that *pip* is using Python 2.x You can find what Python version
   *pip* uses with the following::

      $ pip -V

   If *pip* is working with the wrong Python version, then try to use *pip3*
   which works with Python 3.x
   
**Test installation**

1. Test your installation by importing ``pyebooktools`` and printing its
   version::

   $ python -c "import pyebooktools; print(pyebooktools.__version__)"

2. You can also test that you have access to the ``ebooktools.py`` script by
   showing the program's version::

   $ ebooktools --version

Usage, options and configuration
================================
All of the options documented below can either be passed to the
`ebooktools.py`_ script via command-line parameters or via the configuration
file ``config.py`` which is created along with the logging config file
``logging.py`` when the script ``ebooktools.py`` is run the first time with any
of the subcommands defined `below`_. The default values for these config files
are taken from `default_config.py`_ and `default_logging.py`_, respectively.

Command-line parameters supersede variables defined in the configuration file.
Most parameters are not required and if nothing is specified, the default value
defined in the default config file ``default_config.py`` will be used.

The ``ebooktools.py`` script consists of various subcommands for the
organization and management of ebook collections. The usage pattern for running
one of the subcommands is as followed:

.. code-block:: terminal

  ebooktools {edit,convert,find,rename,split} [<OPTIONS>]
  
Where ``[<OPTIONS>``] include general options (as defined in the
`General options`_ section) and options specific to the subcommand (as defined
in the `Script usage, subcommands and options`_ section).

`:warning:`
 
   In order to avoid data loss, use the ``dry-run`` or ``symlink-only`` option
   when running some of the subcommands (e.g. ``rename`` and ``split``) to make
   sure that they would do what you expect them to do, as explained in the
   `Security and safety`_ section.

General options
---------------
Most of these options are part of the common library `lib.py`_ and may affect
some or all of the subcommands.

General control flags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``-h``, ``--help``; no config variable; default value ``False``

  Show the help message and exit.

* ``-v``, ``--version``; no config variable; default value ``False``

  Show program's version number and exit.

* ``-q``, ``--quiet``; config variable ``quiet``; default value ``False``

  Enable quiet mode, i.e. nothing will be printed.

* ``--verbose``; config variable ``verbose``; default value ``False``

  Print various debugging information, e.g. print traceback when there is an
  exception.

* ``-d``, ``--dry-run``; config variable ``dry_run``; default value ``False``

  If this is enabled, no file rename/move/symlink/etc. operations will actually
  be executed.

* ``--sl``, ``--symlink-only``; config variable ``symlink_only``; default value
  ``False``
  
  Instead of moving the ebook files, create symbolic links to them.

* ``--km``, ``--keep-metadata``; config variable ``keep_metadata``; default
  value ``False``
  
  Do not delete the gathered metadata for the organized ebooks, instead save it
  in an accompanying file together with each renamed book. It is very useful
  for semi-automatic verification of the organized files with
  ``interactive_organizer.py`` or for additional verification, indexing or
  processing at a later date. [KM]_

Options related to extracting ISBNs from files and finding metadata by ISBN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``-i <value>``, ``--isbn-regex <value>``; config variable ``isbn_regex``; see
  `default value <https://github.com/raul23/pyebooktools/blob/52795d9d45d5ae0e666a45cbafb6e4919343dfda/pyebooktools/configs/default_config.py#L65>`__
  
  This is the regular expression used to match ISBN-like numbers in the supplied
  books.

* ``--isbn-blacklist-regex <value>``; config variable ``isbn_blacklist_regex``;
  default value ``^(0123456789|([0-9xX])\2{9})$``
  
  Any ISBNs that were matched by the ``isbn_regex`` above and pass the ISBN
  validation algorithm are normalized and passed through this regular
  expression. Any ISBNs that successfully match against it are discarded. The
  idea is to ignore technically valid but probably wrong numbers like
  ``0123456789``, ``0000000000``, ``1111111111``, etc. [IBR]_
  
* ``--isbn-direct-grep-files <value>``; config variable
  ``isbn_direct_grep_files``; default value ``^text/(plain|xml|html)$``
  
  This is a regular expression that is matched against the MIME type of the
  searched files. Matching files are searched directly for ISBNs, without
  converting or OCR-ing them to ``.txt`` first. [IDGF]_
  
* ``--isbn-ignored-files <value>``; config variable ``isbn_ignored_files``; see
  `default value <https://github.com/raul23/pyebooktools/blob/52795d9d45d5ae0e666a45cbafb6e4919343dfda/pyebooktools/configs/default_config.py#L68>`__
  
  This is a regular expression that is matched against the MIME type of the
  searched files. Matching files are not searched for ISBNs beyond their
  filename. The default value is a bit long because it tries to make the
  scripts ignore ``.gif`` and ``.svg`` images, audio, video and executable
  files and fonts. [IIF]_
  
* ``--reorder-files-for-grep <value>``; config variable
  ``isbn_grep_reorder_files``, ``isbn_grep_rf_scan_first``,
  ``isbn_grep_rf_reverse_last``; default value ``400``, ``50``
  
  These options specify if and how we should reorder the ebook text before
  searching for ISBNs in it. By default, the first 400 lines of the text are
  searched as they are, then the last 50 are searched in reverse and finally
  the remainder in the middle. This reordering is done to improve the odds that
  the first found ISBNs in a book text actually belong to that book (ex. from
  the copyright section or the back cover), instead of being random ISBNs
  mentioned in the middle of the book. No part of the text is searched twice,
  even if these regions overlap. If you use the command-line option, the format
  for ``<value>`` is ``False`` to disable the functionality or
  ``first_lines,last_lines`` to enable it with the specified values. [RFFG]_
  
* ``--mfo <value>``, ``--metadata-fetch-order <value>``; config variable
  ``isbn_metadata_fetch_order``; default value
  ``Goodreads,Amazon.com,Google,ISBNDB,WorldCat xISBN,OZON.ru``
  
  This option allows you to specify the online metadata sources and order in
  which the scripts will try searching in them for books by their ISBN. The
  actual search is done by calibre's ``fetch-ebook-metadata`` command-line
  application, so any custom calibre metadata `plugins`_ can also be used. To
  see the currently available options, run ``fetch-ebook-metadata --help`` and
  check the description for the ``--allowed-plugin`` option. [MFO]_
  
  *If you use Calibre versions that are older than 2.84, it's required to
  manually set this option to an empty string.*

Options for OCR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``--ocr <value>``, ``--ocr-enabled <value>``; config variable
  ``ocr_enabled``; default value ``False``
  
  Whether to enable OCR for ``.pdf``, ``.djvu`` and image files. It is disabled
  by default and can be used differently in two scripts [OCR]_:
  
  * ``organize_ebooks.py`` can use OCR for finding ISBNs in scanned books.
    Setting the value to ``True`` will cause it to use OCR for books that
    failed to be converted to ``.txt`` or were converted to empty files by the
    simple conversion tools (``ebook-convert``, ``pdftotext``, ``djvutxt``).
    Setting the value to ``always`` will cause it to use OCR even when the
    simple tools produced a non-empty result, if there were no ISBNs in it.
    
  * ``convert_to_txt.py`` can use OCR for the conversion to ``.txt``. Setting
    the value to ``True`` will cause it to use OCR for books that failed to be
    converted to ``.txt`` or were converted to empty files by the simple
    conversion tools. Setting it to ``always`` will cause it to first try
    OCR-ing the books before trying the simple conversion tools.
  
* ``--ocrop <value>``, ``--ocr-only-first-last-pages <value>``; config variable
  ``ocr_only_first_last_pages``; default value ``(7,3)`` (except for
  `convert_to_txt.py`_ where it's ``False``)
  
  Value ``n,m`` instructs the scripts to convert only the first ``n`` and last
  ``m`` pages when OCR-ing ebooks. This is done because OCR is a slow
  resource-intensive process and ISBN numbers are usually at the beginning or
  at the end of books. Setting the value to ``False`` disables this
  optimization and is the default for ``convert_to_txt.sh``, where we probably
  want the whole book to be converted. [OCROP]_
  
* ``--ocrc <value>``, ``--ocr-command <value>``; config variable
  ``ocr_command``; default value ``tesseract_wrapper``
  
  This allows us to define a hook for using custom OCR settings or software.
  The default value is just a wrapper that allows us to use both tesseract 3
  and 4 with some predefined settings. You can use a custom bash function or
  shell script - the first argument is the input image (books are OCR-ed page
  by page) and the second argument is the file you have to write the output
  text to. [OCRC]_

Options related to extracting and searching for non-ISBN metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``--token-min-length <value>``; config variable token_min_length; default
  value ``3``

  When files and file metadata are parsed, they are split into words (or more
  precisely, either alpha or numeric tokens) and ones shorter than this value
  are ignored. By default, single and two character number and words are
  ignored. [TML]_
  
* ``--tokens-to-ignore <value>``; env. variable ``tokens_to_ignore``; see
  `default value <https://github.com/raul23/pyebooktools/blob/52795d9d45d5ae0e666a45cbafb6e4919343dfda/pyebooktools/configs/default_config.py#L86>`__

  A regular expression that is matched against the filename/author/title tokens
  and matching tokens are ignored. The default regular expression includes
  common words that probably hinder online metadata searching like ``book``,
  ``novel``, ``series``, ``volume`` and others, as well as probable publication
  years (so ``1999`` is ignored while ``2033`` is not). [TI]_
  
* ``--owis <value>``, ``--organize-without-isbn-sources <value>``; config
  variable ``organize_without_isbn_sources``; default value
  ``Goodreads,Amazon.com,Google``
  
  This option allows you to specify the online metadata sources in which the
  scripts will try searching for books by non-ISBN metadata (i.e. author and
  title). The actual search is done by calibre's ``fetch-ebook-metadata``
  command-line application, so any custom calibre metadata `plugins`_ can also
  be used. To see the currently available options, run
  ``fetch-ebook-metadata --help`` and check the description for the
  ``--allowed-plugin`` option. *Because Calibre versions older than 2.84 don't
  support the --allowed-plugin option, if you want to use such an old Calibre
  version you should manually set organize_without_isbn_sources to an empty
  string.*
  
  In contrast to searching by ISBNs, searching by author and title is done
  concurrently in all of the allowed online metadata sources. The number of
  sources is smaller because some metadata sources can be searched only by ISBN
  or return many false-positives when searching by title and author. [OWIS]_

Options related to the input and output files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``--oft <value>``, ``--output-filename-template <value>``; config variable
  ``output_filename_template``; default value:
  
  .. code-block:: bash
  
     "${d[AUTHORS]// & /, } - ${d[SERIES]:+[${d[SERIES]}] - }${d[TITLE]/:/ -}${d[PUBLISHED]:+ (${d[PUBLISHED]%%-*})}${d[ISBN]:+ [${d[ISBN]}]}.${d[EXT]}"
  
  By default the organized files start with the comma-separated author name(s),
  followed by the book series name and number in square brackets (if present),
  followed by the book title, the year of publication (if present), the ISBN(s)
  (if present) and the original extension. [OFT]_
  
* ``--ome <value>``, ``--output-metadata-extension <value>``; config variable
  ``output_metadata_extension``; default value ``meta``
  
  If ``keep_metadata`` is enabled, this is the extension of the additional
  metadata file that is saved next to each newly renamed file. [OME]_

Miscellaneous options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``--log-level <value>``; config variable ``logging_level``; default value
  ``info``

  Set logging level for all loggers. Choices are
  ``{debug,info,warning,error}``.

* ``--log-format <value>``; config variable ``logging_formatter``; default
  value ``simple``

  Set logging formatter for all loggers. Choices are
  ``{console,simple,only_msg}``.

* ``-r``, ``--reverse``; config variable ``reverse``; default value ``False``

  If this is enabled, the files will be sorted in reverse (i.e. descending)
  order. By default, they are sorted in ascending order.
  
  *NOTE: more sort options will eventually be implemented, such as random sort.*

Script usage, subcommands and options
------------------------------------
The usage pattern for running a given **subcommand** is the following:

.. code-block:: terminal

  ebooktools {edit,convert,find,rename,split} [<OPTIONS>]
  
Where ``[<OPTIONS>]`` include general options and options specific to the
subcommand as shown below.

`:information_source:`

  Don't forget the name of the Python script ``ebooktools`` before the
  subcommand.

All subcommands are affected by the following global options:

* `-h, --help`_
* `-v, --verbose`_
* `-q, --quiet`_
* `--verbose`_
* `--log-level`_
* `--log-format`_

The `-h, --help`_ option can be applied specifically to each subcommand or
to the  ``ebooktools.py`` script (when called without the subcommand). Thus
when you want the help message for a specific subcommand, you do:

.. code-block:: terminal

  ebooktools {edit,convert,find,split} -h
 
which will show you the options that affect the choosen subcommand. 

|

And if you want the help message for the whole ``ebooktools.py`` script:

.. code-block:: terminal

  ebooktools -h
  
which will show you the project description and description
of each subcommand without showing the subcommand options.

|

In the subsections below, you will find a definition for each of the
supported subcommands for automated and semi-automated organization and
management of large ebook collections.

Description
"""""""""""                       
Tries to find `valid ISBNs`_ inside a file or in a ``string`` if no file was 
specified. Searching for ISBNs in files uses progressively more
resource-intensive methods until some ISBNs are found, for more details see

- the `documentation for ebook-tools`_ (shell scripts) or
- `search_file_for_isbns()`_ from ``lib.py`` (Python function where ISBNs
  search in files is implemented).

Global options
""""""""""""""
The global options that especially affect this script are the ones `related to
extracting ISBNs from files`_ and the `OCR ones`_.

Specific options
""""""""""""""""
The only subcommand-specific option is:

* ``--irs <value>``, ``--isbn-return-separator <value>``; config variable
  ``isbn_ret_separator``; default value ``\n`` (a new line)
  
  This specifies the separator that will be used when returning any found
  ISBNs.

Input argument
""""""""""""""
* ``input_data``; no config variable; **required**

  Can either be the path to a file or a string. The input will be searched for
  ISBNs.

Description
"""""""""""
This is probably the most versatile subcommand. It can automatically organize 
folders with huge quantities of unorganized ebook files. This is done by 
extracting ISBNs and/or metadata from the ebook files, downloading their full 
and hopefully correct metadata from online sources and auto-renaming the 
unorganized files with full and correct names and moving them to specified 
folders. It supports virtually all ebook types, including ebooks in arbitrary 
or even nested archives (like the other subcommands, it assumes that one file
is one ebook, even if it's a huge archive). OCR can be used for scanned ebooks 
and corrupt ebooks and non-ebook documents (pamphlets) can be separated in 
specified folders. Most of the general options and flags above affect how 
this subcommand operates, but there are also some specific options for it.

Examples
========
More examples can be found at `examples.rst`_.

Example 1: convert a pdf file to text **with** OCR
--------------------------------------------------
To convert a pdf file to text **with OCR**:

.. code-block:: terminal

   $ ebooktools convert --ocr always -o converted.txt pdf_to_convert.pdf
   
By setting ``--ocr`` to ``always``, the pdf file will be first OCRed before
trying the simple conversion tools (``pdftotext`` or calibre's 
``ebook-convert`` if the former command is not found).

.. code-block:: terminal

   INFO     Running pyebooktools v0.1.0a3
   INFO     Verbose option disabled
   INFO     OCR=always, first try OCR then conversion
   INFO     Will run OCR on file 'pdf_to_convert.pdf' with 1 page...
   INFO     OCR successful!

Example 2: find ISBNs in a pdf file
-----------------------------------
Find ISBNs in a pdf file:

.. code-block:: terminal

   $ ebooktools find pdf_file.pdf

**Output:**

.. code-block:: terminal

   INFO     Running pyebooktools v0.1.0a3
   INFO     Verbose option disabled
   INFO     Searching file 'pdf_file.pdf' for ISBN numbers...
   INFO     Extracted ISBNs:
   9789580158448
   1000100111

The search for ISBNs starts in the first pages of the document to increase
the likelihood that the first extracted ISBN is the correct one. Then the
last pages are analyzed in reverse. Finally, the rest of the pages are
searched.

Thus, in this example, the first extracted ISBN is the correct one
associated with the book since it was found in the first page. 

The last sequence ``1000100111`` was found in the middle of the document
and is not an ISBN even though it is a technically valid but wrong ISBN
that the regular expression `isbn_blacklist_regex`_ didn't catch. Maybe
it is a binary sequence that is part of a problem in a book about digital
system. 

Uninstall
=========
To uninstall the package ``pyebooktools``::

   $ pip uninstall pyebooktools
   
`:information_source:`

   When uninstalling the ``pyebooktools`` package, you might be informed
   that the configuration files *logging.py* and *config.py* won't be
   removed by *pip*. You can remove those files manually by noting their paths
   returned by *pip*. Or you can leave them so your saved settings can be
   re-used the next time you re-install the package.

   **Example:** uninstall the package and remove the config files

   .. code-block:: console

      $ pip uninstall pyebooktools
      Found existing installation: pyebooktools 0.1.0a3
      Uninstalling pyebooktools-0.1.0a3:
        Would remove:
          /Users/test/miniconda3/envs/ebooktools_py37/bin/ebooktools
          /Users/test/miniconda3/envs/ebooktools_py37/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyebooktools-0.1.0a3.dist-info/*
          /Users/test/miniconda3/envs/ebooktools_py37/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyebooktools/*
        Would not remove (might be manually added):
          /Users/test/miniconda3/envs/ebooktools_py37/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyebooktools/configs/config.py
          /Users/test/miniconda3/envs/ebooktools_py37/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyebooktools/configs/logging.py
      Proceed (y/n)? y
        Successfully uninstalled pyebooktools-0.1.0a3
      $ rm -r /Users/test/miniconda3/envs/ebooktools_py37/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyebooktools/

Limitations
===========
Same limitations as for `ebook-tools`_ apply to this project too:

  * Automatic organization can be slow - all the scripts are synchronous
    and single-threaded and metadata lookup by ISBN is not done
    concurrently. This is intentional so that the execution can be easily
    traced and so that the online services are not hammered by requests.
    If you want to optimize the performance, run multiple copies of the
    script **on different folders**.
    
  * The default setting for ``ISBN_METADATA_FETCH_ORDER`` includes two
    non-standard metadata sources: Goodreads and WorldCat xISBN. For
    best results, install the plugins (`1`_, `2`_) for them in calibre and
    fine-tune the settings for metadata sources in the calibre GUI.


Roadmap
=======
- Port all `ebook-tools`_ shell scripts into Python

  - |ss| ``organize-ebooks.sh``: **done**, *see* `organize_ebooks.py`_ |se|
  - ``interactive-organizer.sh``: **working on it**
  - |ss| ``find-isbns.sh``: **done**, *see* `find_isbns.py`_ |se|
  - |ss| ``convert-to-txt.sh``: **done**, *see* `convert_to_txt.py`_ |se|
  - |ss| ``rename-calibre-library.sh``: **done**, *see* `rename_calibre_library.py`_ |se|
  - |ss| ``split-into-folders.sh``: **done**, *see* `split_into_folders.py`_ |se|
- Add a ``fix`` subcommand that will try to fix corrupted PDF files
  by checking first if they are corrupted based on one of the following 
  methods:
  
  * ``pdfinfo``
  * ``pdftotext``
  * ``qpdf``
  * ``jhove``
  
  Then, fix them based on one of the following methods: 
  
  * ``gs``: Ghostscript
  * ``pdftocairo``: from Poppler
  * ``mutool``: it does not "print" the PDF file
  * ``cpdf``
    
  **References:**
    
    * `Some user tested first three pdf-checking methods 
      <https://superuser.com/a/1546294>`__ (results: ``pdfinfo`` fastest 
      and ``qpdf`` slowest)
    * `Some user tested jhove <https://superuser.com/a/1204692>`__
    * `Some user provides gs command for linux <https://superuser.com/a/282056>`__
    * `Some user provides pdftocairo command <https://superuser.com/a/608862>`__
    * `Some user proposes mutool on Ubuntu (can also be installed on macOS with 
      brew) <https://superuser.com/a/923800>`__
    * `Some user used cpdf to fix broken files <https://superuser.com/a/1228662>`__
    * `Official website for cpdf <https://community.coherentpdf.com/>`__
    * `Install qpdf with homebrew <https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/qpdf>`__
    * `Install qpdf with MacPorts <https://ports.macports.org/port/qpdf/summary>`__
- Test on linux
- Add tests on `Travis CI`_
- Eventually add documentation on `Read the Docs`_
- Add a ``remove`` subcommand that can remove the following data from a PDF
  file: bookmarks and attachments.
  
  **Reference:** `Use cpdf <https://community.coherentpdf.com/>`__

Security and safety
===================
Important security and safety tips from the `ebook-tools documentation`_:

  Please keep in mind that this is beta-quality software. To avoid data loss,
  make sure that you have a backup of any files you want to organize. You may
  also want to run the scripts with the ``--dry-run`` or ``--symlink-only``
  option the first time to make sure that they would do what you expect them to
  do.
  
  Also keep in mind that these shell scripts parse and extract complex
  arbitrary media and archive files and pass them to other external programs
  written in memory-unsafe languages. This is not very safe and
  specially-crafted malicious ebook files can probably compromise your system
  when you use these scripts. If you are cautious and want to organize
  untrusted or unknown ebook files, use something like `QubesOS`_ or at least
  do it in a separate VM/jail/container/etc.

**NOTE:** ``--dry-run`` and ``--symlink-only`` can be applied to the following
subcommands:

* `interact`_
* `organize`_
* `rename`_
* `split`_: only ``--dry-run`` is applicable

Credits
=======
* Special thanks to `na--`_, the developer of `ebook-tools`_, for having made
  these very useful tools. I learned a lot (specially ``bash``) while porting
  them to Python.
* Thanks to all the developers of the different programs used by the project
  such as ``calibre``, ``Tesseract``, text converters (``djvutxt`` and
  ``pdftotext``) and many other utilities!
